# FVM Dataverse Hack: Build the new data economy with the Filecoin Virtual Machine - Devpost

![demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZ80eJTB7dw)

We want two IPIPs: one for [onboarding data](https://github.com/restic/rest-server/tree/master/examples/compose-with-grafana) with HTTP POST, and one for [authoring](https://github.com/opensource-rant/sandpack) (modifying/pathing) it with HTTP PUT. This allows us to ship most useful onboarding first, and then do [authoring as an optional add-on](https://github.com/opensource-rant/payments), which services may support, but dont have to (if they are only onboarding to filecoin etc).
